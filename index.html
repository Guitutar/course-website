            <h2>Project Overview:</h2> 

            <div>
	            Guitar is one of the most common instruments people try to pick up and learn, but if you
				have never played an instrument before, this could be a difficult feat to accomplish. Lessons may
				be too expensive, or maybe you are taking lessons but want to improve your practicing efficiency
				to show your teacher that you can move on to harder songs. One of the unique parts about
				learning guitar compared to other instruments are the chords and strumming combination.
				Tablature, or tabs, was created to be an alternative to learning how to play a song without
				learning how to read sheet music. While tabs are easy to find, guitar sheet music is usually not
				made and strumming patterns arenâ€™t connected with the tabs. In order to learn the combination of
				notes and strumming, users have to listen to a song over and over or find an instructional video
				on YouTube.
			</div>
			&nbsp;
			<div>
				As the process of learning to play any instrument is difficult, our goal is to simplify this
				ordeal for someone trying to learn to play the guitar. To simplify the learning process, we have
				chosen to create Guitutar, a tutoring device that is implemented in the neck of an electric guitar.
				The custom fretboard will help its user learn songs and scales by lighting up fingerings on the
				correct frets, recognize correct chord and note inputs.

                <ol>
                    <li>PSSC #1: An ability to interact with the system through an external user interface such as a phone or remote.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #2: An ability to interface the microcontroller with an external device via Bluetooth.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #3: An ability to recognize and process pitches played by a user through a sensing interface.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #4: An ability to display chords and notes on an LED array on the guitar neck.</li>
                    <li>PSSC #5: An ability to have the microcontroller support two modes for user learning and full playback.</li>
