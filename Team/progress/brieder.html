            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 19 January 2017 <br>
            <b>Total hours: </b> 9 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            This week for me consisted primarily of configuration of the lab computer, a lot of discussion of potential plans and revisions that we needed to employ moving forward as a team, and the construction of the website. No physical construction of the product has started as of writing this progress report, but design changes have been discussed and plans to begin prototyping have been conceptualized.
            <br> <br>
            Configuring the computer was a simple but necessary task - we need a terminal to access various Linux utilities and we need an editor to... edit text files (such as those that comprise this website). As such, I installed Cygwin on the lab computer along with a number of utilities that we may need throughout the semester (scp, ssh, bash, etc.). I also installed Sublime Text as a text editor for the team and set configuration so that general formatting (i.e., tabs vs. spaces, tab width) could remain consistent regardless of who was editing the file.

            <br>
            Additionally, I set up the website (with enormous help from the template) to display team information, locate documents, and fix broken links. Organization and file structure of the site was the largest contribution to the time sink of setting it up. I also set up an organization on GitHub for the team with each of our members as contributors to the organization. I believe that utilizing a solid version control system is vital to the success of project organization, so I wanted to enforce the idea of git usage for the team. Configuring the project as an organization also allows compartmentalization of repositories so that specific components of the project (e.g., project website, phone app, microcontroller drivers) can remain separate.
            <br><br>
            Much of our discussion as a team this week went into prototyping - determining how we're going to develop our project without diving immediately into guitar modification and heavy construction. We came up with two specific needs for prototyping: note recognition and note display. As such, we discussed a mechanical system that puts tension on the strings that can be pressed down against metallic strips emulating "frets" in order to determine if we're properly recognizing pitches through a "switch array" of the strings and the frets forming a grid and contacts when pressed down. Additionally, prototyping for pitch display will consist of utilizing the microcontroller to drive a small array of LEDs to display effective notes - an exercise in displaying notes on an LED array without full construction of the product.

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 27 January 2017 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 11 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            My primary efforts this week fell within discussion of software design and architecture, part choosing, further general computer configuration, and continuing iteration on design choices we made for the project this week. 
            <br> <br>
            I had several discussions with Cole throughout the course of the week regarding what kind of format we should be storing data in as well as how we should progress through our modes of operations. Cole presented the idea of using a tree to encode notes as they should be sent to the guitar. As such, we came up with the idea of a binary tree where each edge is a bit in a representation that yields an encoding for every string/note combination. Since there are 132 possible string/note combinations on a 21-fret guitar (6*21 + 6 for open strings), we determined that we would need an 8-bit (255 entry) encoding of all notes. In order to dictate when to stop turning LEDs on and to wait for a response, we agreed that 8'hFF (all 1's) should be a 'stop' control signal. An example of a four-entry encoding is shown below and the full-size tree was agreed to be trivially feasible within C. 
            <br>
            Additionally, we discussed the flow of operation from a state machine design perspective in order to help him write the Software Overview. I created a state machine for him to work from pictured below that allows transitioning between song selection, mode selection, and the two currently intended modes. Within "LEARNING" mode, I proposed that as long as the song isn't finished, we should display the note, wait for input, and then transition based on the correctness of the note - a process that balances on our ability to turn vibrations from sensors into booleans and perform encoding on notes for analysis. The "REALTIME" mode is significantly simpler and only requires the reading of a note encoding as well as the interpretation of a numeric delay within the same type of 8-bit encoding discussed previously that accompanies every note. The exact implementation details of an encoding aren't set in stone yet, but the necessity has been acknowledged and Cole and I have been exchanging ideas regularly.

            In addition to software design this week, I spent a significant amount of time researching Bluetooth modules for the component report and for our ultimate design. I decided that Serial Port Profile (SPP), a Bluetooth profile that allows connected devices to transmit and receive data as if there was a physical connection between them, was a necessity for our design, as Bluetooth is serving the purpose in our context of replacing a wired serial interface with a wireless one. After a lot of digging, I eliminated all but two Bluetooth modules which are discussed within the component analysis report: the Microchip Technology BM78 and the Silicon Labs BLE113-A-M256K. The BM78 supports SPP, utilizes BM78 and UART, and has an average sensitivity, moderately accessible supply, and the lowest price of the investigated components. The BLE113, however, has an explicitly listed data rate, interfaces with more serial options, and has lower voltage and current supply requirements. The decision has currently been to progress with the BM78, but the advantages of both options still need to be considered as a team.
            <br> <br>

            <br>
            As we progress further through this design, we're coming to more and more conclusions about what is and isn't possible for us to implement on the guitar. We've had several roadblocks such as the shorting of powered strings across a finger that is being addressed through alternating power, the issue of the bridge shorting the entire system due to its conductive properties that is going to be attempted to be addressed by insulating each string using liquid rubber or heatshrink wrapping, and the placement of LEDs on the neck. We continue to make large design choices daily and all play devil's advocate in order to ensure that we're thinking of every detail with the project. Each of us play the role of providing alternate technical solutions to the problems we come up with which necessitates a significant amount of brainstorming time as a team at this junction. As such, a significant amount of personal contribution is done here - not only by me, but everyone on the team. I serve the role as the sole computer engineer and bring what electric design experience I have to the table to keep us on the forward path.
