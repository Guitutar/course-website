            <h2>Progress Report for Jen Isaza</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> Jan. 13, 2017 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Syllabus week included standard planning and preliminary work. The final proposal assignment was based off of the initial proposal that was turned in during the previous semester. This final proposal made us begin to think about our overall goals of the project by forming our PSSCs. In order to make the estimated budget, I helped by researching parts costs and creating the table. In order to complete the final proposal, research was done to see how similar projects made their guitar. One that specifically helped us with brainstorming was a senior design project by a youtuber named Andrew Garza. Although the purpose of his guitar is not the same as ours, the insertion of the LEDs on the neck of the guitar led us to our solution of altering and then replacing the neck of the guitar. A picture of his final product is seen below.

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> Jan. 20, 2017 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 9 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Work for Week 2 mainly consisted of brainstorming and planning with the team. One of the preliminary steps for planning of the project was making our team website after Brian installed Sublime Text as a text editor. This was one of the first times I had dealt with HTML coding, so I was happy to gain more experience with this valuable skill and begin to understand its logic and structure. 
            </br></br>
            Further planning, division of tasks and deciding upon each teammateâ€™s strong suits will help in the future in order to work more efficiently. Many design changes were discussed and are still being decided upon in order to have a clear idea of how we should move forward with the project. One idea that we are especially dwelling upon is how to recognize what note the user plays. We are currently designing a switch matrix system which uses the frets and strings of the guitar as a circuit in itself. A problem that we ran into was the amount of wiring the method will need, since playing a chord will need to result in multiple frets being used. 
            </br></br>
            I also researched which electronic components we will need during this planning phase. I looked into some of the recommended microcontrollers for the project, including the STM Arm Cortex-M3 32-bit, which we decided upon after consideration for what components we would need to use. This microcontroller allows USB 2.0, has 2 ADCs, and power saving modes, which are only a few of the many included features that we will need to use.

             <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> Jan. 27, 2017 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 12 <br>

            Week three started by testing the connection of the string to fret switch matrix that we will be using to check if the correct note is played by the user. A 5V, 1A power supply was connected in series to a 1000 ohm resistor and an LED. With the resistor attached to a string, I pressed down on the string to make a connection with the fret while touching the LED to that fret. The LED lit up, meaning the test was a success, and also that touching the string while current ran through it was not a safety hazard. This test was tried on every string to see if the circuit would be complete no matter the thickness of the string. A drawing of the circuit can be seen below. 
            </br></br>

            </div>
            </br></br>	
            Although the safety of pushing down one string at a time was tested, there was still a concern that pushing down all strings at the same time in a bar chord would cause a short accross the whole circuit. To solve this problem, we decided to run current through each string at different times so that even if multiple strings were pressed down, no short would occur. 
            </br></br>
            Another concept that was changed from the original design was the LED array on the frets. After doing some more research into Charlie Plexing, we discovered that this method only allows one LED to be lit up at a time. This could be corrected by blinking the LEDs at different frequencies and tricking the eye to think that multiple LEDs are on at the same time. Although this method would work, we decided to do a simpler method of making a row and column selection system, similar to the switch matrix used for the note selection. All of the negatives of the same row of LEDs would be connected to each other and then each "fret" would be connected in parallel. Similarly, each "string" would model how each column of LEDs would have their positives connected in series. This idea was represented on a breadboard using LEDs and 1k ohm resistors. Using a microcontroller, we may be able to test how this idea could work as a prototype for future implementation.
            </br></br>

            </div>
            </br></br>	
            One of the final concepts changed was the method by which we would pick up the vibrations from the strings to signal when the user actually strummed the guitar. The 7BB-20-6L0 Piezo element disc sensor was determined to be our best option after some research into how these vibration sensors would actually pick up the vibrations. Other versions used a bead that would rest on the string and measure the vibrations through movement. This method of measuring vibration could distort the sound though, and possibly create a buzzing sound whenever the user strummed the guitar. The disc sensor, on the other hand, would rest on the bridge of the guitar and measure vibrations picked up by the bridge itself from the strumming. 
            </br></br>
            The microcontroller that was selected and ordered this week was the PIC32MX570F512L. This microcontroller had all of the capabilities we needed with extra features to spare, such as 512 Kbytes of flash memory, 81 I/O pins, and 48 ADC channels. Other features included are bluetooth and USB capability which will be important for the app user interface and the charging of the battery. Next week, I will be delving further into PCB design through Eagle tutorial samples and beginning to design the board with the PIC microcontroller we chose.
