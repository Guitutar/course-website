            Syllabus week included standard planning and preliminary work. The final proposal assignment was based off of the initial proposal that was turned in during the previous semester. This final proposal made us begin to think about our overall goals of the project by forming our PSSCs. In order to make the estimated budget, I helped by researching parts costs and creating the table. In order to complete the final proposal, research was done to see how similar projects made their guitar. One that specifically helped us with brainstorming was a senior design project by a youtuber named Andrew Garza. Although the purpose of his guitar is not the same as ours, the insertion of the LEDs on the neck of the guitar led us to our solution of altering and then replacing the neck of the guitar. A picture of his final product is seen below.

            Work for Week 2 mainly consisted of brainstorming and planning with the team. One of the preliminary steps for planning of the project was making our team website after Brian installed Sublime Text as a text editor. This was one of the first times I had dealt with HTML coding, so I was happy to gain more experience with this valuable skill and begin to understand its logic and structure. 
            </br></br>
            Further planning, division of tasks and deciding upon each teammate’s strong suits will help in the future in order to work more efficiently. Many design changes were discussed and are still being decided upon in order to have a clear idea of how we should move forward with the project. One idea that we are especially dwelling upon is how to recognize what note the user plays. We are currently designing a switch matrix system which uses the frets and strings of the guitar as a circuit in itself. A problem that we ran into was the amount of wiring the method will need, since playing a chord will need to result in multiple frets being used. 
            </br></br>
            I also researched which electronic components we will need during this planning phase. I looked into some of the recommended microcontrollers for the project, including the STM Arm Cortex-M3 32-bit, which we decided upon after consideration for what components we would need to use. This microcontroller allows USB 2.0, has 2 ADCs, and power saving modes, which are only a few of the many included features that we will need to use.
            </br></br>

            Week three started by testing the connection of the string to fret switch matrix that we will be using to check if the correct note is played by the user. A 5V, 1A power supply was connected in series to a 1000 ohm resistor and an LED. With the resistor attached to a string, I pressed down on the string to make a connection with the fret while touching the LED to that fret. The LED lit up, meaning the test was a success, and also that touching the string while current ran through it was not a safety hazard. This test was tried on every string to see if the circuit would be complete no matter the thickness of the string. A drawing of the circuit can be seen below. 
            </br></br>
            <div align="center">

            </div>
            </br></br>	
            Although the safety of pushing down one string at a time was tested, there was still a concern that pushing down all strings at the same time in a bar chord would cause a short accross the whole circuit. To solve this problem, we decided to run current through each string at different times so that even if multiple strings were pressed down, no short would occur. 
            </br></br>
            Another concept that was changed from the original design was the LED array on the frets. After doing some more research into Charlie Plexing, we discovered that this method only allows one LED to be lit up at a time. This could be corrected by blinking the LEDs at different frequencies and tricking the eye to think that multiple LEDs are on at the same time. Although this method would work, we decided to do a simpler method of making a row and column selection system, similar to the switch matrix used for the note selection. All of the negatives of the same row of LEDs would be connected to each other and then each "fret" would be connected in parallel. Similarly, each "string" would model how each column of LEDs would have their positives connected in series. This idea was represented on a breadboard using LEDs and 1k ohm resistors. Using a microcontroller, we may be able to test how this idea could work as a prototype for future implementation.
            </br></br>

            </div>
            </br></br>	
            One of the final concepts changed was the method by which we would pick up the vibrations from the strings to signal when the user actually strummed the guitar. The 7BB-20-6L0 Piezo element disc sensor was determined to be our best option after some research into how these vibration sensors would actually pick up the vibrations. Other versions used a bead that would rest on the string and measure the vibrations through movement. This method of measuring vibration could distort the sound though, and possibly create a buzzing sound whenever the user strummed the guitar. The disc sensor, on the other hand, would rest on the bridge of the guitar and measure vibrations picked up by the bridge itself from the strumming. 
            </br></br>
            The microcontroller that was selected and ordered this week was the PIC32MX570F512L. This microcontroller had all of the capabilities we needed with extra features to spare, such as 512 Kbytes of flash memory, 81 I/O pins, and 48 ADC channels. Other features included are bluetooth and USB capability which will be important for the app user interface and the charging of the battery. Next week, I will be delving further into PCB design through Eagle tutorial samples and beginning to design the board with the PIC microcontroller we chose.

            This week, the team delved further into our own specialties. In order to prepare for the build of our future PCBs, I downloaded Eagle and began many of their tutorials, in addition to Sparkfun tutorials. I have previous experience using DxDesigner, which is a similar PCB editing pregram, but my work mainly focused on efficiency of routing and transferring design specs that were already made. Therefore, I especially focused on design requirements while going through the tutorials. Placement requirements, such as making sure connectors are facing an edge of the board or placing a decoupling capacitor close to the IC, were some of the important details that would have to be considered when designing a board. 
            </br></br>

            </br></br>	
            </br></br>
            One major difficulty from this week was finding the microcontrollers that we orded (neither the PIC32MX5700F512L-I/PF or -50I/PT) in Eagle. The only PIC32 in Eagle that we could find was the PIC32MX570F512H-50I/PT which has 64 leads instead of 100. However, after counting the number of I/O pins that we would need, we ruled the 64-lead option out. The switch and LED matrices alone would require 56 I/O pins which is above the 49 I/O pin capability of the 64-lead microcontroller. To solve this problem, we need to decrease the number of I/O pins through shift registers or multiplexing, or we need to use the 100 lead microcontroller. We decided to use shift registers for the LED matrix in addition to using the 100 lead microcontroller, in case we end up needing more I/O pins. In order to progress in Eagle, Austin and I will have to create our own microcontroller design and add it to the Eagle library. 
            </br></br>
            The group also made a lot of changes to the overall design of the fretboard. Instead of removing and milling the fretboard, we will now be making the PCB as the fretboard and then putting a clear plastic over the PCB as protection. I came up with the plastic idea after looking at phone screen protectors, so I researched what plastics these protectors are made from. Most phone protectors are made from plastics called PET and TPU, but I also found some vinyl sheeting that might work just as well. Vinyl is also much easier to find in sheets and is cheaper. Difficulties in this plan may come from the separation of the fretboard from the neck of the guitar. In order to weaken the glue, the neck must be heated up so that we can separate the fretboard and the frets. In order to have the frets connect to the PCB, the sides of the PCB would have copper leads coming out of the sides where each fret would be placed. This way, we would be able to have a continuous plastic sheet cover the fretboard, instead of cutting slots in the plastic for each fret. Other concerns deal with attaching the plastic to the fretboard. One idea is to make a side adhesive, which would make the plastic coating permanent. Another idea is making the plastic layer latch down and removable, which would then add the challenge of attaching the plastic to the latch while maintaining comfort for the user. 
            </br></br>
            One of the most helpful ideas this week was making the PCB board double sided. The bottom side would contain all of the parts that may be more pressure sensitive, and the top side would only contain LEDs and frets, which would touch the plastic coating and be pressed by the user. We also investigated different materials that could be used for the coating on guitar strings in order to insulate them. Our prototype for the week proved that the liquid rubber coating we bought would work as advertised and insulate the wire that was dipped in it. One side was connected to power with an LED and the insulated side was just connected to an LED. The side with the power was the only side whose LED lit up, meaning that the rubber did, in fact, insulate the wire.   </br></br>
            <div align="center">

            </div>
            </br></br>	
            While this test worked, we still have to consider whether the rubber would not fail when bent and attached to the guitar due to the friction between the strings and the bridge. Professor Meyer suggested looking into heat shrink tubing, which he thinks may be more durable than the liquid rubber. After doing some research, I found "Big Bends String Sleeves" which are made to go between the strings and the bridge. However, we are not positive if these sleeves would actually isolate the string based on the "correct" way the sleeves are to be placed, as seen in the picture below.

            There was a lot of progress towards preparing for further prototyping this week. All parts were ordered and many arrived, such as string sleeves, the lithium ion battery and its USB port, and an extra guitar neck for prototyping. This extra neck will be used to test the removal process of the fretboard. Unfortunately, the neck that was ordered off of Amazon was a Tele guitar neck instead of a Strat guitar neck. Although the difference is small, we tried to attach the Tele guitar neck and found that it would not be flush with the body of the guitar. The only difference between the two is that the Strat heel is rounded, while the Tele heel is squared off.

            For the Mechanical Overview this week, I compared the two products that have influenced Guitutar the most. Andrew Garza's senior design project especially helped the Guitutar get started with some of the the initial ideas. These ideas eventually evolved into better methods that would be more suitable for our guitar design. Fretlight was a commercial product that had unique features such as a light-up nut that would show when to play open strings, as well as a USB charging port and apps as a user interface. Although we did not base our project off of this design, the Guitutar has evolved separately to become very similar to the Fretlight guitars in terms of functionality. 
            </br></br>	

            This week was especially significant for designing the PCBs. After looking at the different requirements for the PCBs, I measured out the neck of the guitar and split the PCBs into five pieces so that they would meet the 4in length maximum. In order to hide the seams of the PCBs, I made the length of each one end right after a fret. Another difficulty was deciding the shape of the PCBs. Since the guitar neck is trapazoidal, we decided to make rectangular PCBs and then cut off any extra parts to make the trapazoidal shape. Buying rectangular PCBs should save us money so that we do not have to custom order the PCBs. The only worry about this design is that if we need side traces for the fret connections, the cuts will have to be very exact so as not to ruin these traces. Mapping out the PCBs also assured us that the microcontroller would most likely be able to fit on the underside of a middle PCB. This idea will become more clear when we try to lay out all of the traces. Shift registers should help us avoid the problem of having too many traces in the way of the microcontroller and other parts. One downside of having the microcontroller on the bottom of the PCB is that we may not be able to have the necessary decoupling capacitors as close as we would like. As advised in lecture, these decoupling capacitors are most convenient and effective if they are place underneath the microcontroller; however, this will not be possible if the microcontroller is on the back of the PCB. 
             <div align="center">

            </div>
            </br></br>
            Since we are unsure if the microcontroller will be able to work well on the back of the PCBs, we decided to design a case that would house the microcontroller on the back of the guitar neck. The case would be glued to the underside of the neck and we would have to wire the micro to the rest of the PCBs from there. Austin was able to design this casing with his AutoCAD experience. Brian also contributed this week by making a prototype program for the microcontroller and dev board that was provided for testing for the PIC32MX570F512L. The program scrolls through a few LEDs in a similar structure to those that we will be using for Guitutar. Another prototype was started by Cole for the future app that we will be using for the user interface. We decided to use the Android app platform since it is one of the most intuitive platforms for users who have never made an app before. Future work for me will be to investigate the necessary components that our microcontroller will need for its stamp board. We will also have to create the schematic symbol for our 100 pin micro, since it is not in Eagle. I was able to go through all of the additional tutorials that were posted through the 477 website, which included the instructions on how to create your own library symbol. We will be able to use the already designed layout for another TQFP 100 pin micro, but we will have to make our own schematic version in order to redraw any pins that are different from the existing 100 pin micro.

	     We were able to make a lot of progress this week with the PCB development. After doing different tutorials, I was able to apply what I had learned to this week's tasks of completing a parts library and preliminary schematics design. Austin and I split up different parts designs for the week, so I designed the shift registers, piezo, and USB PowerBoost with its battery. I also designed the LED and shift register schematic below.

We also completed the stamp board design this week, which was created by following the minimum requirements found in the microcontroller datasheet.

            </br></br>	
 Some troubles that we are running into are schematic sizing and not being able to use more than two with the free version of Eagle. We are also worried about future programming of the microcontroller, since the stamp board will not fit within the guitar neck. Future concerns include a possible extra schematic that represents the actual PCBs more accurately. Right now, our schematic includes multiple parts that will not actually be represented on the PCB, such as the switch matrices from the frets and strings, the USB and battery, and the piezo. These parts are were important to include for an overall representation of the design, but are not convenient when transferring the from schematic to layout design. In order to prepare for the layout design, we must double check all connections and clean up the schematics so that the microcontroller is connected to the rest of the parts without the stamp boaard connections.

Other difficulties on the software side may affect our hardware design, as well. Brian has been having trouble working with the PIC32 due to different library issues with Harmony. Since there are more example programs with the PIC24, we may have to change to this microcontroller instead. This change would not greatly affect the PCB design, except for new pin connections. The main difference between the two microcontrollers is that the PIC24 is 16bit instead of the 32bit capabilities of the PIC32.

	This week, I worked to clean up the schematics that we created last week and begin the layouts of the stamp board and PCBs. Last week, we created all of the devices for the whole guitar. While these devices were helpful for planning purposes, they were not transferrable for a layout. The main PCB that was originally created was split into the five PCBs that we will actually be using for the fretboard of the guitar. Each of the PCBs were very similar, except for the first PCB that includes the Bluetooth board and the third PCB which includes the microcontroller. The main schematic was able to be used for the stamp board, so that layout was created first. Some changes that were suggested were cleaning up the capacitor connections under the microcontroller and double checking the Vcap that needs to be 10 microfarads, unlike the other capacitors.

            <br><br>

Most changes for the week happened after the Wednesday lab. The main additions were the resistor packages between the shift registers and the LEDs and the addition of the crystal oscillator schematic. We decided to add resistor packages instead of individual resistors in order to save space when creating the layout board. After looking at the oscillator designs from the PIC32 data sheet, I decided to choose the 16MHz crystal in order to support the high frequency operation that we may use. The crystal schematic is only supplementary, but will be added as a backup in case the internal oscillators do not function at the frequency that we need or with the accuracy that we need.

            </div>
            <br><br>
After adding these changes and dividing the PCBs, I began preparing for the layout boards. I made new measurements for the placement of the LEDs and dimensions for the boards from the new 22 fret guitar neck that we ordered and added lines on the layout board for guidance. One of the main troubles I've had with this third PCB is that the capacitors can't be on the underside of the PCB because of the LEDs. Since they have to be on the same side of the microcontroller, the capacitors majorly block many of the important pins that we will need for the other PCBs. Another difficult factor in having five PCBs is that Eagle will not let you open multiple schematics at a time, so measurements that will be necessary when connecting PCBs will be very difficult to make accurate. Overall, this week introduced many challenges with the PCB layout, and a lot of redo designs were made. Work for next week will have to start early, since we have so many new additions to make in order to keep on schedule.

          This week focused on finishing and ordering the stamp board and making necessary changes for the PCB3 in order to move onto the other PCBs. One of our main problems with PCB progress has been the problem that all of the other PCBs depend on PCB3. We have made constant changes to PCB3 which changes where the traces to the other PCBs will go. Some additions we made to the PCBs these past two weeks were the addition of through-holes for the fret connections, adding a ground plane to avoid excessive vias, and extending and mapping out all traces from the micro to the edges of the board. After talking to a TA, we discovered that we had been using the most basic layout for our PIC32, and that we would need many additional capacitors on both our stamp board and our micro. The stamp board was updated within the day and was ordered with the appropriate layout.

            <br><br>
The presentation from Week 8 brought up a lot of concerns for this week. Most of the problems that our audience brought up concerned the hardware, which will change our PCB. One concern was the shift registers, which currently require the use of a resistor packes which takes up more room than the shift register itself. To avoid this problem, Prof. Meyer suggested using a current limiting shift register, which uses I2C instead of SPI, and would not require us to include resistors for the LEDs. While this initially sounded like a good solution, our micro only has two I2C pins, which can handle eight shift registers each. In order to fit the other shift registers, we would have to add a mux, which would probably end up taking up as much room as the resistors. This solution would probably save some room, but the redesign efforts to change around pins and traces would not be worth the hassle to save this questionable amount of room, unfortunately. Other concerns from Joe mainly had to do with power. Although we are planning on covering the PCB with plastic sheeting in order to protect it from static shock, we did not think about the static that would come through the frets while the user is playing. The solution to this problem would be to add a network of 330 kohm resistors and enable the internal pull up resistors of the micro by enabling the CNPUx and disabling the CNPDx, which would protect against up to 4950V. Another option that we are adopting is getting rid of the Piezo and using the internal inductive pickup of the guitar itself. The Piezo would have been too difficult with the outside vibrations from knocking into the guitar or being in loud spaces. By using the inductive pickup of the guitar, we will be able to filter the frequencies of sound that we want to recognize, so that outside vibrations will not give us a false positive for a strum. The last addition we will make is an LDO that will step down the 5.2V from the battery to the 3.3V for the microcontroller.

            <br><br>
Future considerations for our PCB design will be finding the right sized pads for the PCB to PCB connections and the correct sized holes to attach the frets to the micro. George got us on the right track by introducing us to the "jumper" library, but these jumpers even look too large to connect PCB3 to PCB2 especially, since there are so many traces to connect.

            Before leaving for spring break, Austin was able to submit our PCB3 and make the necessary changes for ordering. Our PCB3 and stamp board are now here, and we will be able to begin soldering for testing and programming of the PIC32. Before soldering, we will perform tests on some of the traces and pads that seem too close and could have been shorted.

            This week, I have been working to finish PCB2 and have its connection pins on either side line up with PCBs 1 and 3. Since 3 has already been ordered, I lined up the correct pins with PCB3, and had to change some of the pin order for PCB1. One change for the week is deciding what value of resistance network will be necessary for operation. Earlier, we chose a package that was already in the Eagle database as a sort of "filler" until we figured out other specifications. Since the shift register will output 3.3V and the LEDs need 2.65V at around 10mA, we decided that we would need around a 65Ohm resistor network. Unfortunately, the resistor network package on PCB3 does not come in 65Ohms, so we decided to use the closest value at 100Ohms. Fortunately, I was still able to change the other PCBs and found much smaller resistor networks at 65Ohms that will greatly help out with space conservation. PCB2 is now completed and I need still need to make small connector changes to PCB1 as well as switch out the old resistor packages for the new ones.

            We are mainly focusing on PCBs 1, 2, and 3, because these are the PCBs that will be used the most by the user. In order to meet our overall goals, it will be in our best interests to make these three work as a minimum and then move on to PCBs 4 and 5 if there is time. These two boards will pose more challenges due to the increasing amount of frets on the upper half of the neck and the increased connections and shift registers that accompany these frets.

This week was mainly spent fixing errors with the PCBs. I finished switching out all of the resistor packages for the smaller 68Ohm ones and redid all of the traces for PCBs 1,2, and 3. On Wednesday, I realized that the PCB3 we ordered had an error on it that was, unfortunately, unfixable. I added connections for SCK, SCLR, and RCK because they were not added to the board and I also changed the dimensions to the PCB. This weekend, we will need to double check more of the dimensions so we don’t have to reorder any more boards. If we have time, we will start on PCB4 and 5. However, we would like to have the first three PCBs functioning first so that we will have a fully working project for our goals. Cutting the PCBs is another challenge that we faced this week. Austin tried cutting one of the PCBs for practice, and learned that we may need to put more room on either sides of the areas that we need to cut. There is a more exact saw in the AFL lab that I have used before that may be more accurate.

This week mostly consisted of finalizing the PCBs for me. I had to do a lot of rework on traces and measurements since we needed to make sure that our final PCBs would all align as planned. The pins on the outer edges of each PCB had to be double checked in order to make good connections and DRC changes were made in order to move any wires that were too close. Even though we may have been able to work with our original PCB3, we decided to redo the PCB3 design after we realized that we needed to add shift register traces on either side for G, RCK, SCK, and SCLR. Additionally, we would have had to use different, larger 100 Ohm resistors for PCB3 compared to the newer, smaller 68 Ohm resistors that we will be using for the other PCBs. After completing most of the work over the weekend, a GitHub error deleted all of our work, so I redid all of the PCB work while Austin moved forward with hardware design. He worked to get the amp working with the circuit below and collected all of the parts from Joe that we would be able to use while we wait for our ordered parts.

The PCBs are now ordered and all of the parts that Joe did not have in his inventory have also been ordered. Our next steps are to practice cutting on the PCBs that we already have in order to get a smoother line when our new PCBs come in. In order to make the cutting process easier, we made sure to move the PCB layout so that there is more room on either side for cutting. Austin also decided to work on developing PCB4 in case we decide that we want to expand our design further up the guitar for more experienced users. Another major step we made this week was from Brian on the software side. After having trouble with the clocking signal output and the libraries, he was able to display the correct LEDs on the stamp board provided to us. There is a lot of promise for development of both hardware and software next week after this week of troubleshooting!

          	This week was a break from our normal PCB routine, since we were able to order all the PCBs last week. Since the PCBs still have not come, the hardware side has been at a bit of a standstill. Developing the Bluetooth module has been one of our main priorities for the team, since this feature is what decides if we can actually use the app that Cole has been developing or not. Since we need a breakout board in order to communicate with the Bluetooth module, Austin created one in Eagle that has been separately ordered. We made sure that the measurements would align with a breadboard, making each side a factor of 0.5in away from the other. This week's assignment is the user manual, which I am responsible for completing. One of the challenges for the user manual was creating a visual of what our system might eventually look like. The user manual has brought up a lot of user feature considerations that we had not thought of previously. Some of these features include a power button, designing a pack that will store the powerBoost and battery, figuring our where and how to attach this power pack, and how power and aux wires are going to connect to the PCBs. These considerations are smaller goals outside of our PSSCs, but would help in a real-world setting where a user may try to use our product. We are hoping that the PCBs and Bluetooth breakout boards will come next week in order to make progress with the software design. We only have two more weeks until the SparkChallenge, so these PCBs are really going to make a difference in whether we will be able to participate or not.

          	This week was much more productive compared to last week! I began preparing the fretboard for layout out the PCBs and all of the PCBs came in the week to be worked on. For the fretboard preparation, I cut the acrylic overlay with a dremel saw and sanded out the sides. I still have to make incisions to the side for each fret connection. I also removed all of the metal frets from the fretboard that we already removed. While Brian and Cole continued working on connecting with the micro and Bluetooth, I began prepping PCB1 with all of the necessary parts. Joe made a breakout board for the Bluetooth module, so I figured that PCB1 would be the most useful for future testing with the Bluetooth. Communicating with the micro has been an ongoing frustration for the team in order to move forward. Austin may have figure out the problem when he was resoldering the new PCB3 with the necessary capacitors and resistors for the basic micro circuit. We may have forgotten to solder one of the necessary capacitors onto the test micro circuit, which could explain the micro not functioning properly even when the power pins were reading correctly. My next challenge with the PCBs will be soldering the new resistor arrays onto the PCBs. Although soldering has a quick learning curve, these resistor arrays require the microscope since they are so small, which could present its own problems.

            This week, we saw the most progress out of any week so far. Much of the hardware development was finalized in order to program the guitar neck. After having issues with the VCAP voltage, we replaced the micro only to find that we were having the same problems. Austin figured out that these high voltages were happening because the VSS was not grounded. Another problem we were having was the 3.3V LDO was outputting 4.6V instead of 3.3V with a Vin of 5.2V. After trying different possible solutions and reading the data sheet, we discovered that the Adj pin that we were not using needed to be grounded instead of not connected. Austin made a 3D printed box for all of the power components and amplifier that we velcroed to the back of the guitar, as well. A few further problems that we were having with LEDs not lighting up were solder issues with the tiny 68Ohm resistors we are using. Most of these issues were cold solder joints that were made out of hesitation to avoid shorting the resistors. After these fixes, we moved onto the solder bridges between PCBs which was probably the most difficult step in the whole process. These solder bridges would come loose whenever they were moved and they had to be hot glued down to give extra support. Brian made a code for LED checks that would scroll through each LED on the fretboard. PCBs 1 and 4 had the most LEDs that would not light up, which we assume is from the solder bridges (but we cannot be sure yet). Code for the user mode worked when the fret board was not attached to the acrylic top layer. When the fretboard was attached to one fret externally and we would strum one string while touching the fret, an LED would change as planned. However, when the whole fretboard was put together and each fret was connected to the PCBs, this user mode would no longer work. We still need to do some tests as to why this is happening, but we can tell that something is shorting when pushing down on the frets, since the full playback mode will restart when a user pushes on a fret. Another concern is that the fretboard is too high when everything is put together and the guitar is strung. The strings touch all of the frets when strung, so that only the top note of every string is detected. Future work that will be needed is trouble shooting some of the LEDs, working on lowering the height of the total fretboard, figure out what could be shorting the guitar when a fret is pushed, and getting Bluetooth to work.
