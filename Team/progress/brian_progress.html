            This week for me consisted primarily of configuration of the lab computer, a lot of discussion of potential plans and revisions that we needed to employ moving forward as a team, and the construction of the website. No physical construction of the product has started as of writing this progress report, but design changes have been discussed and plans to begin prototyping have been conceptualized.
            <br> <br>
            Configuring the computer was a simple but necessary task - we need a terminal to access various Linux utilities and we need an editor to... edit text files (such as those that comprise this website). As such, I installed Cygwin on the lab computer along with a number of utilities that we may need throughout the semester (scp, ssh, bash, etc.). I also installed Sublime Text as a text editor for the team and set configuration so that general formatting (i.e., tabs vs. spaces, tab width) could remain consistent regardless of who was editing the file.
            <br> <br>

            	<img style="float: right;" width="48%" src="Team/progress/img/BrianImg/SublimeConfigured.png">
            	<p style="clear: both;">
            </div>
            <br>
            Additionally, I set up the website (with enormous help from the template) to display team information, locate documents, and fix broken links. Organization and file structure of the site was the largest contribution to the time sink of setting it up. I also set up an organization on GitHub for the team with each of our members as contributors to the organization. I believe that utilizing a solid version control system is vital to the success of project organization, so I wanted to enforce the idea of git usage for the team. Configuring the project as an organization also allows compartmentalization of repositories so that specific components of the project (e.g., project website, phone app, microcontroller drivers) can remain separate.
            <br><br>
            Much of our discussion as a team this week went into prototyping - determining how we're going to develop our project without diving immediately into guitar modification and heavy construction. We came up with two specific needs for prototyping: note recognition and note display. As such, we discussed a mechanical system that puts tension on the strings that can be pressed down against metallic strips emulating "frets" in order to determine if we're properly recognizing pitches through a "switch array" of the strings and the frets forming a grid and contacts when pressed down. Additionally, prototyping for pitch display will consist of utilizing the microcontroller to drive a small array of LEDs to display effective notes - an exercise in displaying notes on an LED array without full construction of the product.
