Guitar is one of the most common instruments people try to pick up and learn, but if you have never played an instrument before, this could be a difficult feat to accomplish. Lessons may be too expensive, or maybe you are taking lessons but want to improve your practicing efficiency to show your teacher that you can move on to harder songs. One of the unique parts about learning guitar compared to other instruments are the chords and strumming combination. Tablature, or tabs, was created to be an alternative to learning how to play a song without learning how to read sheet music. While tabs are easy to find, guitar sheet music is usually not made and strumming patterns aren’t connected with the tabs. In order to learn the combination of notes and strumming, users have to listen to a song over and over or find an instructional video on YouTube.
 
As the process of learning to play any instrument is difficult, our goal is to simplify this ordeal for someone trying to learn to play the guitar. To simplify the learning process, we have chosen to create Guitutar, a tutoring device that is implemented in the neck of an electric guitar. The custom fretboard will help its user learn songs and scales by lighting up fingerings on the correct frets, recognize correct chord and note inputs.
